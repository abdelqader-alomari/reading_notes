One of the best way to improve your skills is by contributing to open source projects.

The open source community provides a great opportunity for aspiring programmers to distinguish themselves; and by contributing to various projects, developers can improve their skills and get inspiration and support from like-minded people. But most importantly, they can prove that they can build fantastic experiences that people love.

## Why to contribute in open source project?

- There are a lot of enthusiasts who simply believe that code should be open. They're idealists who want to make the world a better place, and it drives them to contribute code. The desire to share can be a powerful motivator.

- OSS gives you a great start. Beginners might start by fixing minor things, such as a bug in a library, sending a pull request, or even writing a piece of documentation. However, beginner developers can also learn to write so-called "clean code" – code that is readable and maintainable – while contributing to open source projects. When developers realize that their code is exposed to the world, it makes them focus on making that code easy to understand and support.

## Guide for Open source contribute

- [First contributions](https://github.com/multunus/first-contributions) is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.

- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net) is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help. They label those projects with things like “up-for-grabs”, “jump-in” or “help wanted.”

- [Good First Issues](goodfirstissues.com) is a site that aggregates the latest issues with the label “Good First Issue”, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle (see here), goodfirstissues.com empowers first-time contributors to find and select issues that they want to solve.

- [Good First Issue](goodfirstissue.dev) curates easy pickings from popular open-source projects, and helps you make your first contribution to open-source.

- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.
Read blog posts and guides on how to contribute to an open source project, then pick one!
Wondering what someone else’s first contribution was? You can easily find out any GitHub usernames “First Pull Request” here! (I think you’ll find that most people’s first PRs were relatively small like Kent’s).

We think that open source projects should value civility, kindness, and patience with new developers. We encourage you to explore projects that have a published Code of Conduct.
