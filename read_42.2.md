I quickly read These Topics:

- The code I’m still ashamed of
- Project Dragonfly, Google’s censored search engine
- Amazon workers demand Jeff Bezos cancel “Recognition” software
- Google and AI
- Microsoft Employees demand end of ICE contract

It most revolve about human rights in result which I totally agree with, human rights and ethics come first, it will in long term bring all the benefits so it's top priority
Each Article discuss about a serious ethical rights, some of it about AI in weapons!, some of it about coding in company which final product harmful for young girls,
the other about employees and their families separation and the other about sell AWS face recognition ... etc.
In order to evaluate or make an opinion or discuss in general we need to reflect what mentioned above in Code of ethics and understand deep details and look for facts.

Big Data is our Civil Rights issue: Big Data is nowadays one of the most important Power resources, It's a power of knowledge...

What is the good side and negative side in my opinion?
The positive side that now in marketing field we can easily choose targeted audience in gender, age, location, interests, study and a lot of other segmentation.
And it's improving with days with AI technologies for new generation.

So What is the negative side which is cause human right issue ?
with the culture of big data, become less freedom and privacy !
What if as a human I don't want to any company take my data and target me with advertisment ?
So I suggest to give the choice to each person to select if he/she want to involve with that or no, in addition filter that data as much as possible...
