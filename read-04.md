### Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions:

## Links:

* Links are created using the a element.
* The a element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the to field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.


## Layouts:

* <'div'> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## How does pair programming work?

* pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
* The Driver is the programmer who is manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and writing—code.Handling the “mechanics” of coding
* The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver, The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.

### Why pair program?
* Programming languages. Similar to a foreign language have 4 skills: listening,speaking,reading, and writing
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
* **Greater efficiency:** Produces higher-quality code, research the problem and reach a solution faster, nhances technical skills, team communication, and enjoyability.
* **Engaged collaboration:** both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone and more engaging and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help.
* **Learning from fellow students:** working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.
* **Social skills:** Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.
* **Job interview readiness:** A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant,They will carry out exercises together.
* **Work environment readiness:** graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
